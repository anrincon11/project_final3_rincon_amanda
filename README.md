# Project Final 3

What a great way to end the semester! This project was an awesome way to tie everything in that we have learned all semster long.

## Custom jQuery Code Explanation

This custom code can be found in the social media section on the contact page. When a click is performed on any of the social media icons, they will animate with a flip.

## Custom JavaScript Code Explanation

This custom code can be found on the buttons in the gift cards page. When a click is performed on any either of the buttons, a thank you message will populate.

## Resources

* [jQuery API Documentation](http://api.jquery.com/) was used to better understand event handlers and to know what options are available for certain events.

* [CSS3 Generator](http://api.jquery.com/) was used to help style different elements of the project.

* [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) was used to in several sections of the project. Animations can be seen on all main headers and with the social media icons.

* [MeanMenu](http://www.meanthemes.com/plugins/meanmenu/) was used to implement one of the required jQuery plugins. It can be visible in mobile view and will create a hamburger menu for easy navigation access.

* [Textillate](https://jschr.github.io/textillate/) was used to implement the second required jQuery plugin. It can be visible on the headings on all pages of the site. It is activated when the view goes to the page, so in order to see it work, scroll down to a heading and refresh the page.

* [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) was used to better understand jQuery events and pseudo elements.

* [HTML5 Boiler Plate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169) was used to help style out some of the HTML structure elements with the "visuallyhidden" class to keep the design clean.

* Other than what is listed above, I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

This project made me realize how far I've come with writing and understanding JavaScript and jQuery code. This was really a great way to end the semester. Thank you for everything!
